# notes from me

1. I replaced grunt with gulp. Run `gulp` for preview and `gulp build` for building.
2. App description, wireframes and mockups are in the `_design` dir. I designed them using Adobe Fireworks. Exported slides are in the `_design/export` dir.


## jschallenge

The purpose of this github repository is to challenge YOU, yes YOU, to show us a bit of your skills in angular, node and javascript.

It's not what's written in your resume we are interested in, it's what you can do...
We believe in creativity, so let your imagination run wild.

We've prepared the following repository. It's a building block for you to play with one of our public API endpoints. You'll find that it makes a simple call to one of our APIs to check for car availability.

The rest, and what you do with this boilerplate is up to you. Add, remove, rebuild, destroy, make a video game, book a car, do some crazy data analytics, build an awesome UI... Do whatever you want. Just build something cool :)

**[Email](mailto://hr@smove.sg) us with a link to your fork when you're done, blow our socks off and show us your awesomeness.**

Cheers.

smove's geeks

P.S: take as little or as much time as you want.
